# Automatic_Irigation_System
 The circuit is based on PIC microcontroller and also a soil moisture sensor.  An auto irrigation system which measures the moisture of the soil and automatically turns on or off the water supply system. 
 
 Purpose of this project to develop an automatic irrigation system, to meet the requirements and guidelines given in the "EME315	Embedded Systems" subject. (EME315	Embedded Systems - 3rd Year Mechtronics Engineering Module, Sri Lanka Technological Campus)
